Gurtaj Khabra, 2021

This was a side project in which I could test my capabilities and reinforce the skills I learned in my cmput274 course.
I didn't want to create something super simple so I ended up opting for a pathfinding application.

This gave me the opportunity to learn about user interfaces in python which was not covered in my course. It also
allowed me to improve my knowledge on OOP and computational thinking.

Note: The program is some what inefficient and has a few bugs. Because of this, using board sizes larger than
35 x 40 is not recommended. Doing so may cause the gui to be suboptimal and the program will run slow.
